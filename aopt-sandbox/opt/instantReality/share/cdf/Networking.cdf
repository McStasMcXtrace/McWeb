(Higher levels of this component extend the URL support of a browser, such as supporting URNs (Uniform Resource Name), which are a superset of the URL concept. A URN allows an abstract resolution mechanism to be invoked to locate a resource. This allows a resource to be located on the local machine or a platform dependent resource to be located using the URN along with platform-specific identifiers.)]]>
